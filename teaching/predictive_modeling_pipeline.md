# Notes


## Startup 

Setup: https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/blob/main/local-install-instructions.md

Open jupyter lab

```bash
conda activate scikit-learn-course
jupyter lab 
```

Then open the notebook from there.

Introduce the notebook and live coding 
- I will walk through the notebook and explain as I type
- You have to slow me down when I am too fast (also the helper!); ask questions anytime
- We'll have exercises
- The collaborative document keeps track of the code in case you fall behind
